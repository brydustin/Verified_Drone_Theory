# Formalization Diary — Antenna Feasibility Nonemptiness

A running, dated log of the Isabelle/HOL formalization of the antenna-feasibility
*nonemptiness* theorem. Kept partly as a development record and partly as raw
material for the paper's "formalization notes." Entries are newest-first within a
day; commit hashes refer to the working repo (`antenna-nonemptiness`), mirrored
into the monorepo `Verified_Drone_Theory` under `Applied_Math_Formalization/`.

## 2026-05-30 (Lambda-common) — prop_Lambda_common via collinearity of the (∂E₁,∂Q₁₁) vectors

`prop_Lambda_common` PROVED. As originally stated it was UNprovable: `Lam` was an
abstract `fixes` function and the hypotheses `Lam i j = 0` had no stated relation to
the conclusion `Fj` (3 linear equations in 2 unknowns are generically inconsistent).
Restated faithfully to the paper (tex L5434/L5656): `Λ⁽¹¹⁾ᵢⱼ = det ∂(Φ₁,H₁₁)/∂(uᵢ,uⱼ)`
is the `2×2` minor of the gauge-data vectors `vE j = ∂_{uⱼ}E₁ = -2g·BBⱼ - g₁κ·ssⱼ`
and `wQ j = ∂_{uⱼ}Q₁₁`, so the hypotheses become the minor equations
`vEᵢ·wQⱼ = vEⱼ·wQᵢ`. With a nondegeneracy `some vE ≠ 0` (the regular-stratum gauge
`g>0` supplies it), all three vectors `(vEⱼ,wQⱼ)` are collinear, hence share a ratio
`μ` (`wQⱼ = μ·vEⱼ`); then `α = r+gμ`, `β = r²-χ₁₁+g₁μ` solves all three because
`Fⱼ(α,β) = wQⱼ - μ·vEⱼ` (a polynomial identity).

Only **1 real sorry remains**: `lem_h0res_a1a2` (`rk_residue x = 2` for an abstract
`rk_residue :: 'w ⇒ nat`) — a genuine placeholder, NOT provable as stated (false for
an arbitrary `rk_residue`); it needs the concrete residue Jacobian defined and its rank
computed (à la `bigJ_det`).

GOTCHAS: (i) `defines` are SIMULTANEOUS, so a later one cannot reference an earlier one
(`Lam ≡ ... vE ... wQ ...` failed "Extra variables on rhs") — state the minor equations
directly instead. (ii) `\<lambda>` is the reserved lambda binder; do not use it as a variable
name (`∃\<lambda>. ...` fails to parse) — used `\<mu>`.

## 2026-05-30 (uphi) — prop_uphi_codim3: discreteness of the F_eta zero set

`prop_uphi_codim3` PROVED: \<open>Z\<^sub>\<eta> = {u : F\<^sub>\<eta>(u)=0}\<close> is discrete, where
\<open>F\<^sub>\<eta>(u) = cos(\<kappa>u) - \<kappa>(u-\<eta>)sin(\<kappa>u)\<close>, \<open>\<kappa>\<noteq>0\<close>. Appendix down to 2 real sorries
(`prop_Lambda_common`, `lem_h0res_a1a2`).

Key: the zeros are \<^emph>\<open>simple\<close>. At a zero, \<open>F\<^sub>\<eta>'(u) = -2\<kappa> sin\<kappa>u - \<kappa>\<^sup>2(u-\<eta>)cos\<kappa>u \<noteq> 0\<close>:
if both \<open>F\<^sub>\<eta>=0\<close> and \<open>F\<^sub>\<eta>'=0\<close> then substituting \<open>cos\<kappa>u = \<kappa>(u-\<eta>)sin\<kappa>u\<close> gives
\<open>sin\<kappa>u\<cdot>(2+(\<kappa>(u-\<eta>))\<^sup>2)=0\<close>, so \<open>sin\<kappa>u=0\<close> (the factor is \<open>>0\<close>), hence \<open>cos\<kappa>u=0\<close> too ---
contradicting \<open>sin\<^sup>2+cos\<^sup>2=1\<close>. A simple zero is isolated: \<open>F\<^sub>\<eta>'\<close> is continuous, so it
keeps its sign on a ball \<open>(u-\<delta>,u+\<delta>)\<close> (`order_tendstoD` + `eventually_at`); there
\<open>F\<^sub>\<eta>\<close> is strictly monotone (`DERIV_pos_imp_increasing` / `DERIV_neg_imp_decreasing`),
hence injective, so \<open>u\<close> is the only zero in the ball.

GOTCHAS: (i) substitute the zero relation with `simp only: e1` BEFORE `algebra_simps`
--- in `using e1 ... simp`, `algebra_simps` reorders \<open>e1\<close> into a sum and never uses it
as the rewrite \<open>cos\<kappa>u \<rightarrow> \<kappa>(u-\<eta>)sin\<kappa>u\<close>. (ii) the original `assumes "\<kappa> \<noteq> 0"` was
UNNAMED; naming it `\<kappa>:` is required to cite it (`Undefined fact "\<kappa>"`).

## 2026-05-30 (KLM minors) — prop_KLM_1 + prop_KLM_2 via Cramer / cofactor identities

Both `prop:KLM` minors PROVED; appendix down to 3 real sorries (`prop_uphi_codim3`,
`prop_Lambda_common`, `lem_h0res_a1a2`).

- `prop_KLM_1` (`K=L=M=0 \<longleftrightarrow> s=0` on `c\<^sub>1c\<^sub>2c\<^sub>3\<noteq>0`): the \<open>\<Longrightarrow>\<close> direction is FALSE as
  originally stated --- a collinear triple has `\<tau> = s/c = const\<cdot>(1,1,1)`, giving
  `K=L=M=0` with `s\<noteq>0`. Added the good-triple hypothesis `A\<^sub>T = det3 1 1 1 u v \<noteq> 0`.
  Then the clean route is three **Cramer identities**, each a pure `det3` polynomial
  identity (`simp add: det3_def algebra_simps`):
    `s\<^sub>i \<cdot> (\<Prod>\<^sub>j\<^sub>\<noteq>\<^sub>i c\<^sub>j) \<cdot> A\<^sub>T = K + u\<^sub>i L - v\<^sub>i M`.
  Verified out of band via the scalar triple product: `(u\<times>v) + u\<^sub>1(v\<times>\<one>) - v\<^sub>1(u\<times>\<one>) =
  (A\<^sub>T,0,0)`. So `K=L=M=0` forces `s\<^sub>i (\<Prod>c) A\<^sub>T = 0`, and `c\<^sub>j\<noteq>0`, `A\<^sub>T\<noteq>0` give `s\<^sub>i=0`.
- `prop_KLM_2` (one `cos=0 \<Longrightarrow> L\<noteq>0 \<or> M\<noteq>0`): needs the array points pairwise
  DISTINCT (else the relevant minor vanishes). Per case `c\<^sub>i=0`: `c\<^sub>i=0 \<Longrightarrow> s\<^sub>i\<noteq>0`
  (Pythagoras), and `L = s\<^sub>i (\<Prod>c) (v\<^sub>j - v\<^sub>k)`, `M = s\<^sub>i (\<Prod>c) (u\<^sub>j - u\<^sub>k)`, so distinctness
  of points `j,k` gives `L\<noteq>0 \<or> M\<noteq>0`.

GOTCHA (cost a build): a `have sin1: "\<And>w. cos w = 0 \<Longrightarrow> sin w \<noteq> 0"` leaves `w`
POLYMORPHIC (`sin`/`cos` are over `'a::{banach,...}`), so a `fix w :: real` body
mismatches and the `show` fails with the misleading "Failed to refine any pending
goal". Fix: annotate the binder in the statement --- `\<And>(w::real). ...`.

## 2026-05-30 (even later) — astar strict-monotonicity (the double-root injectivity)

`prop_double_param_mono` (`strict_mono_on UNIV (astar \<kappa>)`, \<kappa>\<noteq>0) now PROVED, plus its
prerequisite `astar_deriv`. This is the ingredient behind `cor:double-impossible`
(no two distinct indices are both degenerate-critical), so `cor_double_impossible`
also goes through. Appendix down to 5 real sorries.

- `astar_deriv`: \<open>astar' u = sin\<^sup>2(\<kappa>u)(5+sin\<^sup>2(\<kappa>u))/(1+sin\<^sup>2(\<kappa>u))\<^sup>2\<close> (a manifest SOS \<open>\<ge>0\<close>).
  Built via the quotient rule (`DERIV_divide`, whose denominator is `g*g` not `g\<^sup>2`),
  then the value is simplified through a cleared-numerator polynomial identity
  `?g\<cdot>?g - ?num = 4\<kappa>\<^sup>2 s\<^sup>2(5+s\<^sup>2)`: rewrite the double angles with `simp only: sd cd`
  FIRST, substitute `cos\<^sup>2 = 1-sin\<^sup>2` once, then plain `algebra_simps`/`power2_eq_square`.
- `prop_double_param_mono`: the library only gives nondecreasing from `f'\<ge>0`
  (`DERIV_nonneg_imp_increasing_open`), and `astar'` vanishes at the isolated points
  `sin(\<kappa>u)=0`, so strictness needs an extra argument: if `astar x = astar y` then `astar`
  is constant on `[x,y]`, hence (via `has_field_derivative_transform_within_open` against
  the constant function) `astar' \<equiv> 0` on `(x,y)`, forcing `sin(\<kappa>u)\<equiv>0` there; the same
  transform trick on `sin(\<kappa>\<cdot>)` then gives `cos(\<kappa>u\<^sub>0)=0` too, contradicting `sin\<^sup>2+cos\<^sup>2=1`.

## 2026-05-30 (later still) — Appendix leaves: lem_Fij, the algebra corollaries, prop_double_param_solves

Cleared four more `sorry` leaves in `Nonemptiness_Regnonzero_Appendix.thy` (now 6 real
sorries left):
- `cor_pairambiguity`, `cor_H0subcase`, `cor_vpair22_nonzero` — pure algebra from the
  factorizations (`d\<^sub>ij = -2\<Delta>\<^sub>ij K`, etc.); `mult_eq_0_iff` / `field_simps`.
- `upair_minor_nowhere_dense` — added the missing `continuous_on UNIV` hyp, routed through
  `lines_entire_slice_nowhere_dense`.
- `lem_Fij` — restated noncollinearity as `A\<^sub>T \<noteq> 0` (= `det3 1 1 1 u v`, cleaner than the
  `\<exists>`-line form) and proved via the cancellation identity `F\<^sub>1\<^sub>2 - F\<^sub>1\<^sub>3 + F\<^sub>2\<^sub>3 = a\<cdot>A\<^sub>T`
  (the `a\<^sub>1,a\<^sub>2` terms cancel identically; the `a`-term is exactly the triple determinant).

**`prop_double_param_solves` — the rational-trig identity, now fully proved.** Statement
gets the honest `\<kappa> \<noteq> 0`. The two `Fparam` terms are exact negatives: with `s=sin\<kappa>u`,
`c=cos\<kappa>u`, `astar-u = -sc/(\<kappa>(1+s\<^sup>2))` (term 1 `= -2sc(c-\<kappa>us)/(\<kappa>(1+s\<^sup>2))`) and
`bstar-u\<^sup>2 = 2c(c-\<kappa>us)/(\<kappa>\<^sup>2(1+s\<^sup>2))` (term 2 `= +2sc(c-\<kappa>us)/(\<kappa>(1+s\<^sup>2))`). Key
Isabelle lessons that finally cracked it:
- `field_simps` is the WRONG tool here: it *distributes* `2\<kappa>(1+s\<^sup>2)` into `\<kappa>\<cdot>2 + \<kappa>\<cdot>2s\<^sup>2`,
  loses the factored form, and can no longer discharge `\<noteq> 0` to cross-multiply. Keep
  denominators factored instead.
- Compute `astar-u` and `bstar-u\<^sup>2` as single factored fractions (`amu`, `bmu`); for `bmu`
  clear the denominator with `nonzero_eq_divide_eq` (atomic in `Dn`) rather than
  `diff_divide_distrib` (which explodes the long numerator).
- The cleared-numerator identity `key` must rewrite the double angles with `simp only: sd cd`
  FIRST (exact `sin(2\<kappa>u)`/`cos(2\<kappa>u)` match) BEFORE `algebra_simps`, because `algebra_simps`
  reorders `2\<kappa>u \<rightarrow> \<kappa>(u\<cdot>2)` and then `sin_double`/`cos_double` no longer fire. The leftover
  `2c\<^sup>2+2s\<^sup>2 = 2` is linear in the atoms `c\<cdot>c`,`s\<cdot>s` and closes with the product-form
  Pythagorean `cs` via `argo`: `using cs by (simp only: sd cd, simp add: algebra_simps
  power2_eq_square, argo)`.

## 2026-05-30 (later) — Regnonzero appendix: full skeleton + capstone + first real proofs

New theory `Appendix/Nonemptiness_Regnonzero_Appendix.thy` (session
`Applied_Math_Appendix`, parent `Applied_Math_Nonemptiness`) states EVERY appendix
obligation of `prop:regnonzero` (Appendix A–I), and `Appendix/Nonemptiness_Capstone.thy`
closes START→FINISH: `odd_N_nonemptiness` is *proved* by feeding the four concrete
bad sets (defined from `af`) + feasibility + X0-soundness into the sorry-free
`nonemptiness_from_meager_branches`. So no unstated gaps remain.

Design rule (after corrections): NO locales; lemmas connect either as concrete/universal
facts (real moment map / `det3` / plain reals) or as parametric facts carrying the real
structural hypothesis the concrete object satisfies (`rline_entire`, a chart cover) — like
`nonemptiness_from_branches`. Bugs caught by *trying to prove*:
- `prop:upair`'s global strict-monotonicity of `R(t)` is FALSE (R has poles / is U-shaped);
  restated with an `inj_on` (single-branch) hypothesis.
- `analytic_cut_meager_proj` (single cut ⇒ meager projection) was FALSE (codim-1 cut
  projects ONTO V); replaced by the dimension-drop engine `proj_lowdim_meager` (via
  `rank_deficient_C1_image_meager`).
- `prop:vmixed` was off by a factor 2 (third row is `2vⱼcⱼ`, the `∂_v a₂₂` derivative).

PROVED sorry-free this session: `R_even`, `prop_upair`, `x_plus_sin_pos`, `Num_pos`
(corrected SOS `2Num = t²(2t+sin2t)+2(2t−sin2t)+4t sin²t`), `R_strict_mono_first_branch`,
`ab_eq_R`, `alpha_beta_inj_on_branch` (u-pair branch closed end-to-end); `analytic_cut_nowhere_dense`,
`proj_lowdim_meager`; templates `threecos_meager_in_V`, `Bbranch_meager_in_V`;
`lem_h0res_Bcuts` (β′≠0 transversality); `prop_vcos/vsin/vmixed`; `lem_block` (7 J₅ partials),
`lem_3x3` (3 rank-3 minors); `cor_pairambiguity`, `cor_H0subcase`, `cor_vpair22_nonzero`;
`upair_minor_nowhere_dense`. Down to ~8 real sorries (calculus/transcendental:
`prop_double_param_*`, `prop_uphi_codim3`, `prop_Lambda_common`, `lem_Fij`, `prop_KLM_*`,
`lem_h0res_a1a2`) + the IFT chart keystone + the `(ℝ²)ⁿ ≅ ℝ²ᴺ` wiring.

Traps logged: `*s`/`*v` are cartesian operators (`*sin` lexes as `*s`+`in`) — use variable
`t` and natural spacing; `DERIV_divide` gives `g x * g x` not `(g x)²`; simp distributes
`−(a+b)` before cancelling `(−a)/(−b)` — group/use `divide_minus_right`; `\<^const>` only on
genuine constants (not lemma names); `real^('m::{finite,wellorder})` must annotate the index
sort at EVERY occurrence; non-greedy `lemma (\w+):.*?` regex spans across lemmas
(use `(?:(?!\nlemma ).)*?`).

## 2026-05-30 — Transversality MEAGER stub: blocked on one σ-compact ∃-discharge (full record of dead ends)

**Stop point for the night.** One — and only one — proof step is blocking the whole
`parametric_transversality_meager_euclidean_stub` (stub 2). Everything around it works;
the σ-compact `∃K` discharge does not, and we burned hours on it. This entry records
*exactly* what fails so we do NOT repeat it tomorrow, plus untried ideas to try first.

### Proven + COMMITTED (safe baseline)
- `smooth_chart_meager` / `rank_deficient_C1_image_meager` / `open_sigma_compact_exhaustion`
  (= `lem:smooth-chart-meager`), in `Parametric_Transversality_Euclidean_Base`. Sorry-free,
  `Applied_Math_Nonemptiness BUILD_EXIT=[0]`, committed+pushed earlier today.
- (yesterday) `DM_paper_open_dense_surjective` = `lem:Msurj`; `APPENDIX_PLAN.md`; STATUS reframe.

### In the working tree, UNCOMMITTED and currently BROKEN (build fails at the σ-step)
- `meager_critical_values_from_charts` — meager analog of `negligible_critical_values_from_charts`,
  with a σ-compact hypothesis `sigma` (currently object form `∀i. ∃K. (∀n. compact (K n)) ∧ Crit i = (⋃n. K n)`).
- `charts_core_2d` (the IFT-chart `sorry`) was strengthened with a 4th conjunct giving σ-compact `Crit0`.
- `parametric_transversality_meager_euclidean_stub` (stub 2): proof =
  `elim exE` of `charts_core_2d`'s existential → `meager_critical_values_from_charts` → `meager_subset`.

**What already WORKS inside stub 2** (do not re-litigate these):
- Destructuring `charts_core_2d[OF assms]` via `from … show ?thesis proof (elim exE) fix charts Crit0 D0 assume H: "<body>"`. The `elim exE` peels the 3 function-typed existentials cleanly (this solved the original "obtain hangs/fails" problem).
- `note der/rk/sig = conjunct…[OF H]` to split the 4-conjunct `H`.
- der/rk subgoals of `meager_critical_values_from_charts`: `show "⋀i x. …" using der by auto` / `… using rk by auto` — **verified, terminate**.
- Final: `show ?thesis by (rule meager_subset[OF conjunct1[OF H] meag])` — fine.

### THE BLOCKER — discharge `⋀i. ∃K. (∀n. compact (K n)) ∧ Crit0 i = ⋃(range K)` from `sig`
`sig` (= `conjunct2[OF conjunct2[OF conjunct2[OF H]]]`) is `∀i. ∃K. (∀n. compact (K n)) ∧ Crit0 i = ⋃(range K)`
— i.e. **the goal and `sig` are the same statement** (modulo `∀i` vs `⋀i`). Yet *every* discharge fails.

**FAILED — do NOT try these again:**
1. `using sig by blast` — **HANGS** (jEdit purple, non-terminating). blast explores the giant `assume H` (the full `?bad ⊆ … ∧ …` with nested quantifiers) that is in scope.
2. `using sig by auto` / `(use der rk sig in auto)` — FAILS ("Failed to finish proof"): auto won't *synthesize* the `∃K` witness from a `∀∃` fact.
3. `obtain K … using sig[rule_format, of i] by blast` — **HANGS** (blast + `H`).
4. `from sig[rule_format, of i] obtain K where "(∀n. compact (K n)) ∧ Crit0 i = ⋃n. K n" ..` — the `..` (exE) FAILS to prove it.
5. `from sig[rule_format] show "∃K…" .` — `.`/`this` FAILS: it won't instantiate the *fact's* schematic `?i` to the goal's concrete `i`.
6. `by (rule sig[rule_format])` (on the meta `⋀i.∃K…` goal) — FAILS ("Failed to apply initial proof method").
7. `from sig show "∃K…" by (rule spec)` — FAILS: `rule spec`'s higher-order unification picks a *constant* `?P`, so the resulting premise ≠ `sig`.
8. `by (rule sig)` (object `∀i.∃K…` goal, object `sig`) — FAILS ("Failed to apply"): can't use an object-`∀` fact as an intro rule for an object-`∀` goal.
9. `by (fact sig)` — FAILS, same shape.
10. `from sig show "∀i.∃K…" .` — FAILS, same.
11. `meager_critical_values_from_charts[where D=D0, OF der[rule_format] rk[rule_format] sig]` — **"OF: no unifiers."** Cause: `der[rule_format]` is `?x∈Crit0 ?i ⟹ …` (schematic `?i ?x`) but the lemma hyp is `⋀i x. x∈?Crit i ⟹ …` (meta-bound) → schematic-vs-bound mismatch. (So OF cannot discharge the meta-`⋀` der/rk hyps from the object der/rk facts.)
12. `from sig show "∃K…" by (rule spec[of "λj. ∃K. (∀n. compact (K n)) ∧ Crit0 j = ⋃n. K n" i])` — FAILS even with the predicate given *explicitly*. Most likely the literal `Φ` I wrote does not β/η-match `sig`'s stored body (`(⋃n. K n)` prints as `⋃(range K)`), so `from sig` cannot discharge the `∀x. Φ x` premise.

### Root-cause hypotheses (for tomorrow)
- blast/auto family: **hang** (the `assume H` is in scope) or cannot construct an `∃` witness.
- rule/fact/`.`/spec: object `∀`/`∃` quantifiers + a probable **η/representation difference** (`(⋃n. K n)` vs `⋃(range K)`, and possibly the `∃K` binder type) defeat exact matching; HOU picks wrong instances.
- **We have been working BLIND** — we never once printed `thm sig` next to the actual goal. That must change.

### TRY TOMORROW — in this order (all UNTRIED)
1. **Inspect the terms FIRST.** In jEdit put `thm sig` on a scratch line and read the goal at the σ-`show`; diff them character-by-character (η on `range K`, the `∃K` type, sort, `Trueprop`). Do not attempt another proof until we can SEE the exact mismatch.
2. **`elim exE conjE`** instead of `elim exE` + `conjunct…`: split `H` into *directly named* `assume sub … and der … and rk … and sig …`. A directly-assumed `sig` may behave differently from a `conjunct2[OF …]`-extracted one.
3. **`meson` / `metis` with ONLY `sig` passed**: `using sig by meson` — resolution provers are depth-bounded (won't hang like blast) and may close `∀∃ ⟹ ∀∃` without touching `H`. (Sledgehammer was only ever run on the *obtain*, never on this subgoal.)
4. **Hoist the σ-lift into a separate clean lemma** (no `H` in scope): e.g. `lemma σlift: "(∀i. ∃K. P i K) ⟹ <lemma's sigma form>" by blast` proved in a clean context, then `using sig by (rule σlift)` in stub 2 — `rule` applies a closed lemma and does **not** explore `H`. The crux is matching `P`/the term shape.
5. **Reformulate `meager_critical_values_from_charts`** to avoid the `∃`-extraction: take the cover as an explicit family `K :: nat ⇒ nat ⇒ … set` with hyps `compact (K i n)` and `Crit i = (⋃n. K i n)`; stub 2 then supplies `K` from `sig` per-`i` (no global choice needed) — this removes the σ-`∃` discharge entirely. **(Note: axiom of choice is NOT needed — this is pointwise existence; confirmed.)**
6. If the diff in (1) is genuinely η, normalise (`simp only: …`) or restate the σ-hyp literally as `⋃(range K)` to match.

**Bottom line:** the analytic content is done; this is a pure Isar/automation plumbing wall around discharging a trivial `∀∃` in a context polluted by a huge `assume`. Start tomorrow at item (1) — see the terms — then (2)/(4).

## 2026-05-29 (cont.) — Tier 1: `lem:smooth-chart-meager` proved (rank-deficient C¹ image is meager)

`smooth_chart_meager` (sorry-free, `Applied_Math_Nonemptiness` `BUILD_EXIT=[0]`), in
`Parametric_Transversality_Euclidean_Base`: a smooth map from an open `U ⊆ ℝ^m` into
`ℝ^n` with `m < n` has meager image (paper `lem:smooth-chart-meager`, tex L1197).
Proved via the strictly more general

  `rank_deficient_C1_image_meager`: open `U`, `(F has_derivative F' x)(at x within U)`
  on `U`, and `rank (matrix (F' x)) < CARD('n)` everywhere ⟹ `meager (F ` U)`.

**Proof shape (for the paper).** Three ingredients:
1. `open_sigma_compact_exhaustion` — every open `U` in a heine-borel real-normed space
   is `⋃ₙ Kₙ` with each `Kₙ` compact. Construction: `Kₙ = cball 0 n ∩ {x. 1/(n+1) ≤
   setdist {x} (−U)}` (closed margin set via `continuous_on_setdist`, intersect with a
   ball → compact); the `setdist`-margin forces `Kₙ ⊆ U`, and openness (`ball x e ⊆ U`)
   gives the cover. `U = UNIV` handled separately by plain `cball` exhaustion.
2. `baby_Sard` on each compact piece: `rank < n` ⟹ `negligible (F ` Kₙ)`.
3. `Kₙ` compact + `F` continuous ⟹ `F ` Kₙ` compact (closed); a countable union of
   closed negligible sets is meager (`meager_negligible_closed_cover`, already in Base).
The `m < n` corollary discharges the rank hypothesis for free
(`rank (matrix (F' x)) ≤ CARD('m) < CARD('n)` via `rank_transpose`/`rank_bound`).

This is the single highest-leverage Tier-1 lemma: it feeds **both** transversality
stub 2 (`parametric_transversality_meager_euclidean_stub`, rank-deficient case) **and**
`prop:dimZ` facts 1 & 2 of `prop:regnonzero` (`m<n` case). Prototyped in a fast
standalone `HOL-Analysis`-only theory, then folded into the Base theory (reusing its
`meager`/closed-cover chain — no duplication) and verified in the real session.

**Traps hit (recorded for next time):** (i) `cball 0` needs sort `zero` →
`{heine_borel,real_normed_vector}`, not bare `heine_borel`; (ii) annotating an
`obtain` with `(real^'m)` re-imposes the `vec` constructor's bare `finite` sort,
clashing with the context default `{finite,wellorder}` ("finite inconsistent with
default…") — use `nat ⇒ _ set` and let inference recover the element type from `U`;
(iii) `nat_approx_posE` yields `1/of_nat(Suc n) < e`, not `inverse(real(Suc n)) ≤ e`;
(iv) `has_derivative_continuous_on[OF der]` instead of `meson …` to avoid a
unification-bound blowup.

## 2026-05-29 (cont.) — DECISION: commit to the full unconditional `thm:final`; built the complete obligation map

brydustin asked, point-blank, whether there is a real pathway to a *complete* proof
or whether we are chasing a rabbit. Honest answer: there **is** a genuine pathway —
`thm:final` is a Baire closeout over four meager branches (architecture proven), and
each branch reduces to concrete, transcribable obligations. Not a dead end, not a
false theorem. The cost is a large, lopsided appendix. brydustin chose the honest
path: **the complete unconditional theorem.**

Spent this session mapping the *entire* remaining obligation set accurately (the prior
STATUS map had stale entries):

- **Found the ground-truth paper source** (the only place the detailed appendix proofs
  live): `…/Vern_Paulsen_QC/Applied Math/nonemptiness_unified_singlefile_complete.tex`
  (6285 lines). `STATUS.md`'s `L####` index this file; `\label{…}` match the Label
  column. The appendix is **transcribable**, not reverse-engineerable. Recorded in
  memory + `APPENDIX_PLAN.md`.
- **Reframe: `lem:Msurj` (the #1-hardest item per STATUS — the explicit 12×12
  determinant) is already DONE** as `bigJ_det_nonzero`/`bigJ_surj` +
  `DM_paper_open_dense_surjective` (= `W_surj`, the open-dense surjective locus). The
  tex partials (`∂_uA`, `∂_uM₁`, …) are exactly `DM_paper_x_components`. STATUS marked
  it ✗; corrected to ✅. The hardest foundation is behind us.
- **`prop:regnonzero` (tex L1240) needs 4 sets meager:** `π_V(Z_reg)`,
  `π_V(Z∩{H≡0}∩W_surj)` [the "ZH0surj" piece], `B_CaseB`, `B_H0res` — via
  `prop:dimZ`+`lem:smooth-chart-meager`, Appendix I (`cor:caseBmeager`), Appendix H
  (`prop:h0res-meager`) respectively.
- **Transversality stubs analyzed** (`Parametric_Transversality_Euclidean_Base`,
  L369 `charts_core_2d`, L1015 meager-stub): stub 2 = stub 1 (Lindelöf assembly of the
  proven single-point keystone) + rank-deficient-image-negligible + the
  already-proved `meager_negligible_closed_cover`. So **`lem:smooth-chart-meager` is
  the single highest-leverage lemma**: it unblocks the transversality pipeline
  (→ `prop_regzero`, `prop_foldzero`) *and* `prop:dimZ` facts 1&2.
- The Sard theory already provides `negligible_singular_image_2n` (rank-deficient
  C¹ ⟹ negligible image) and the library `baby_Sard`. Gap to *meager*:
  negligible alone ≠ meager; need the σ-compact exhaustion (closed-negligible pieces
  ⟹ meager). That is the **next concrete target**.

## 2026-05-29 (cont.) — P1.6 COMPLETE: regular stratum is open AND dense (real-analytic)

`DM_paper_open_dense_surjective` (sorry-free, `Applied_Math_Nonemptiness`
`BUILD_EXIT=[0]`): for any open `V :: ((real^2)^6) set`,
\[
  \exists U.\ \text{open } U \wedge U \subseteq V \wedge V \subseteq \overline{U}
            \wedge (\forall x\in U.\ \mathrm{surj}\,(D_x M\_paper(x, c0\_paper))).
\]
Take `U = V ∩ {x. m*(x) ≠ 0}`. **Openness** is the C¹ half (`m*` continuous →
`{m*≠0}` open). **Density** is the real-analytic half: `m*` is `rline_entire`
(`rline_entire_m_star`) and nontrivial (`m*(x0)=det bigJ≠0`), so `{m*=0}` is
nowhere dense (`nowhere_dense_m_star_zeros` via the `lines_entire_slice_nowhere_dense`
engine); hence `{m*≠0}` is dense and, `V` being open,
`V ⊆ closure(V ∩ {m*≠0})` (`open_Int_closure_subset`). This is exactly
`rank_lower_semicont_open_dense_propagation` made **unconditional** for the
concrete moment map — and it required the real-analyticity (C¹ alone gives only
openness, as flagged earlier; the generic lemma is false under C¹).

**How the analyticity went through (for the paper):** each entry of the
transported Jacobian `matrix(MJx x)` is `Re`/`Im` of a moment-derivative component
`Moment_Map.DM_paper_x x c0 h $ m`, which is `cline_entire` — phase/`d_phase` are
`cis` of bounded-linear forms, and the `of_real` polynomial weights are
`cline_entire` via `rline_entire f ⟹ cline_entire (of_real∘f)`. The determinant
`m*` is then `rline_entire` (`rline_entire_det_fun`: `det` = sum-of-products of
entries, closed under the `rline_entire` algebra). The whole density argument
reused the **existing** `cline_entire`/`rline_entire`/`lines_entire` engine
(array-factor branch) — no new analytic foundations needed.

**Traps hit this session (autonomous run):** (i) the stale **local
`Nonemptiness_Paper.DM_paper_x`** shadows `Moment_Map.DM_paper_x` (which `MJx`
uses) — qualify `Moment_Map.DM_paper_x`; the two are definitionally equal. (ii)
schematic-binder type trap recurred twice (`w` in `rline_entire_transC_comp`, `V`
in `DM_paper_open_dense_surjective`) — pin types. (iii) engine `lines` hyp is meta
`⋀a v`; supply via a local `have … for a v` (or `rule_format`), not the object
`∀` from `rline_entire_def`.

**Next — P1.7:** feed `DM_paper_open_dense_surjective` to the `ZH0surj` branch:
on the open-dense regular stratum, transversality/Sard ⟹ `meager (ZH0surj ∩ V)`,
discharging that hypothesis of `prop_regnonzero`. (This pulls in the Case-B / H≡0
appendix inputs — the larger remaining piece.)

---

## 2026-05-29 (cont.) — P1.6 (openness): the surjective stratum is open

The first half of P1.6 is done (sorry-free, `Applied_Math_MomentJac` `BUILD_EXIT=[0]`),
in `MomentJac/Moment_Jacobian.thy`:

- `MJx x = transC ∘ (DM_paper_x x c0_paper) ∘ transD` (the transported Jacobian at
  a *general* configuration `x`) and `m_star x = det (matrix (MJx x))`.
- `surj_iff_m_star`: `surj (DM_paper_x x c0_paper) ⟷ m_star x ≠ 0` — a real
  `12×12` endomorphism is surjective iff injective iff its determinant is nonzero
  (`det_nz_iff_inj` + the bijective transports). `m_star_x0_nonzero`:
  `m_star x0_paper = det bigJ ≠ 0`.
- `continuous_m_star`: `m_star` is continuous (`continuous_on_det_fun`, a small
  general lemma: `det` of a continuously-varying matrix; the entries are continuous
  via `continuous_on_DM_paper_x_vec` + `bounded_linear transC`).
- `open_surj_stratum`: `open {x::(real^2)^6. surj (DM_paper_x x c0_paper)}`
  (= `{x. m_star x ≠ 0}`, open by `open_Collect_neq`). This is the C¹
  (lower-semicontinuity-of-rank) half.

**Lesson worth a footnote (the schematic-type trap).** `open_surj_stratum` first
refused *every* closing tactic (`simp`, `unfolding`, `subst`, `metis` all "failed
to apply") on what looked like a trivial set rewrite. The cause was **not** the
tactics: the statement `open {x. surj (DM_paper_x x c0_paper)}` leaves the bound
`x` at a *schematic* type `planar^'n` (nothing pins `'n`), whereas the supporting
facts (`m_star`, `surj_iff_m_star`, forced through `transD : real^12 → (real^2)^6`)
are all at the concrete `(real^2)^6`. So the goal's set and the rewrite's LHS
differ by `'n` vs `6` and nothing unifies. Pinning the binder —
`open {x::(real^2)^6. …}` — fixed it instantly. (Same family as the 05‑27 rule:
*annotate a binder whose type is only pinned through a function applied to it.*)

**Next — P1.6 (density):** `m_star` is `rline_entire` (its matrix entries are
coordinate-polynomials × `cos`/`sin` of the steering form) and nontrivial
(`m_star_x0_nonzero`), so `{m_star = 0}` is nowhere dense (the
`lines_entire_slice_nowhere_dense` engine) ⟹ the surjective stratum is *dense*.
Combined with openness this gives `rank_lower_semicont_open_dense_propagation`
unconditionally; then P1.7 assembly → `meager (ZH0surj ∩ V)` → `prop_regnonzero`.
(Layering of the `rline_entire` engine vs the HMA-free context still to be decided.)

## 2026-05-29 (cont.) — P1.5 COMPLETE: the Jacobian identification `D_xM_paper(x0,c0) = (*v) bigJ`

The keystone connection between the abstract matrix `bigJ` and the *actual*
moment-map function is proved (sorry-free; `Applied_Math_MomentJac` `BUILD_EXIT=[0]`),
in `MomentJac/Moment_Jacobian.thy`:

- `matrix_MJ : matrix MJ = bigJ`, where
  `MJ = transC ∘ (DM_paper_x x0_paper c0_paper) ∘ transD`.
- `MJ_eq_bigJ : MJ = (*v) bigJ`  (via `(*v)(matrix MJ) = MJ` for linear `MJ`).
- `surj_DM_paper_base : surj (DM_paper_x x0_paper c0_paper)` — surjectivity of the
  genuine moment-map derivative at the base point, transferred from `bigJ_surj`
  through the bijective transports.

So `bigJ` is **not just a matrix of numbers**: it is the Fréchet derivative of the
real moment map `M_paper` at the canonical base configuration, in the
`(Re,Im)` × `(u_n,v_n)` coordinates fixed by `transC`/`transD`.

**Proof shape (for the paper):** twelve per-column lemmas `MJ_col1..MJ_col12`,
each `MJ (axis j 1) = (χ i. bigJ$i$j)`. For basis direction `axis j 1` the moment
sums (`sum_6`) collapse to the single base point that direction touches; the
surviving term is `weight · cis(-u_n)` whose `Re`/`Im` (via `base_trig_values`,
the sixth-roots-of-unity values) match `bigJ`'s explicit entries. Shared simp
bundle `MJ_col_simps`; each column discharged by a bounded `exhaust_12[of i]` +
`elim disjE; simp_all`. The second-moment rows (M₁₁/M₁₂/M₂₂) need polynomial-in-π
algebra, supplied by `power_divide`/`power_mult_distrib` (e.g. `9·(π/3)² = π²`).
`matrix_MJ` assembles the columns (case split on `j`); `MJ_eq_bigJ` then uses
`(*v)(matrix MJ) = MJ`; `surj_DM_paper_base` writes
`DM_paper_x x0 c0 = transC_inv ∘ MJ ∘ transD_inv` and composes surjections.
(Engineering: `DM_paper_x_components` and `cos pi`/`sin pi` are already `[simp]`, so
omitted from the bundle to avoid duplicate-rewrite warnings.)

**Next — P1.6 (density) then P1.7 (assembly):**
- *Immediate:* `det (matrix MJ) = det bigJ = -(5·π⁸)/3 ≠ 0` (one line from
  `matrix_MJ` + `bigJ_det_nonzero`) — the regular base point is a *non-degenerate*
  one.
- *P1.6:* the surjective stratum `{x. surj (DM_paper_x x c0)}` is **open and dense**.
  Define the minor `m*(x) = det (matrix (transC ∘ DM_paper_x x c0 ∘ transD))`;
  `m*(x0_paper) = det bigJ ≠ 0` (nontrivial) and `m*` is `rline_entire` (its
  entries are coordinate-polynomials × `cos`/`sin` of the steering form — the
  `rline_entire_coord`/`_cos_inner`/`_sin_inner` base cases + closure). Then
  `lines_entire_slice_nowhere_dense` gives `{m*=0}` nowhere dense ⟹ `{m*≠0}`
  open dense ⊆ surjective stratum. **Layering note:** `rline_entire` lives in
  `Nonemptiness_Paper`; the minor involves nested-vec transports (must stay in the
  HMA-free context), so decide where the density proof lives (likely move the
  `rline_entire` engine into a lower heap theory, or do the density step carefully).
- *P1.7:* assemble `DM_paper_open_dense_surjective` → `meager (ZH0surj ∩ V)` →
  `prop_regnonzero`; then re-import `Moment_Jacobian` into `Nonemptiness_Paper`.

## 2026-05-29 — Diary catch-up + importing higher-order differentiability

### Mea culpa: the diary lapsed

This entry catches up three sessions' worth of work (commits `28846a2`..`a6f5316`)
that landed after the `charts_core_Nn` entry but were never logged here. Going
forward the diary is updated at the end of *every* session, not retroactively.

### What happened since the last entry (reconstructed from git)

- **Moment-map heap (`28846a2` P1.1, `20c7035` P1.2, `1b77582` P1.3).** The
  six-component moment map `M_paper`, its base configuration `x0_paper`/`c0_paper`,
  and the per-term Fréchet-derivative lemmas were factored out of
  `Nonemptiness_Paper.thy` into `BlockDet/Moment_Map.thy` so the expensive
  operator-overload elaboration is paid once at heap-build time.
- **`bigJ` determinant chain (`82baa57`, `66c0e7b`, `ad8e16f`, `f469397`,
  `d01ffdf`, `4192198`).** The `det_A/B/D` row-reduction pieces of the `12×12`
  Jacobian determinant were baked into `Applied_Math_BlockDet`.
- **Sard port (`f9d1110`, `087004b`, `a6f5316`).** `negligible_singular_image_2n`
  — the `(real^2)^'n ≅ real^('n bit0)` transport feeding `baby_Sard` — is now a
  **sorry-free** build theory `SardNegligible/Sard_Negligible.thy`, registered as
  session `Applied_Math_Sard`. Note: this branch needs only **C¹** (a single
  `has_derivative` + non-surjectivity), *not* higher-order differentiability.
- **`chart_zero_projection_meager_stub` (`9a9cc95`)** proved unconditionally —
  closing the fold-zero branch.

### Current `sorry` ledger (verified by grep this session)

- `Nonemptiness_Paper.thy:3650` — `rank_lower_semicont_open_dense_propagation`
  (the C¹ rank-lower-semicontinuity tool feeding `DM_paper_open_dense_surjective`
  → `ZH0surj` → `prop_regnonzero`). **Only C¹.**
- `Parametric_Transversality_Euclidean_Base.thy` — three:
  - `regular_zero_set_projection_local_chart_2d` (line ~373) — **the keystone**:
    regular value ⇒ local smooth chart of the level set.
  - `regular_zero_set_projection_charts_core_2d` (line ~352) — the countable-cover
    assembly built on the keystone.
  - `parametric_transversality_meager_euclidean_stub` (line ~972) — the meager
    conclusion built on the assembly.
- `Regular_Value_Theorem.thy` — **sorry-free**, but **not registered in any
  session/ROOT**. Its theorem `regular_value_local_chart` is the IFT-based engine
  for the keystone: it returns `U, u0, φ, g, Dφ` with `φ differentiable_on U`,
  `φ ` U ⊆ {G=0}`, `openin … (φ ` U)`, `homeomorphism U (φ ` U) φ g`,
  `range(Dφ u) = ker(G'(φ u))`. **Hypotheses: `derG` (Fréchet derivative `G'` as a
  blinfun on `W`) + `contG'` (`continuous_on W G'`, i.e. C¹) + `regp` (`surj G'` at
  `p`).**

### Why we just imported `Higher_Differentiability_Multi`

The keystone is currently stated with only `regular_value_on G (V×Ω) 0`, which
gives a *pointwise* surjective derivative at the zeros but **no continuity of the
derivative**. The IFT engine needs **C¹** (`contG'`). That is precisely the gap
`Higher_Differentiability_Multi` fills:

- `Ck_on 1 G W` (its `Ck_on`/`Ck_at` C¹ notion) ⟹ a continuous blinfun-valued
  derivative on `W` ⟹ discharges `derG` + `contG'`.
- Bridges: `Ck_on_imp_k_times_Fr_on`, `Ck_on_iff_higher_differentiable_on`
  (agreement with the AFP `Smooth_Manifolds.higher_differentiable_on`).

Copied into `HigherDiff/` with its three local deps (`Limits_Higher_Order_Derivatives`,
`Auxiliary_Facts`, `Higher_Differentiability`); registered as session
`Applied_Math_HigherDiff = HOL-Analysis + Smooth_Manifolds`. Builds clean
(`BUILD_EXIT=[0]`). One pre-existing `sorry` in `Higher_Differentiability` ⇒
session kept `quick_and_dirty`.

#### Dependencies imported this session (for the record)

`ITree_Numeric_VCG` machinery from the source project was deliberately **not**
imported — it is only for imperative program verification, irrelevant here.
New session in `ROOT`: `Applied_Math_HigherDiff in "HigherDiff" = HOL-Analysis +
sessions Smooth_Manifolds`.

### Done this session — the C¹ bridge (`Ck1_C1_Bridge.thy`, sorry-free)

New theory `HigherDiff/Ck1_C1_Bridge.thy` (imports `Higher_Differentiability_Multi`,
added to `Applied_Math_HigherDiff`; whole session `BUILD_EXIT=[0]`). It converts
the higher-diff C¹ notion into the regular-value engine's interface:

- `Dblinfun G z ≡ Blinfun (frechet_derivative G (at z))` — the canonical blinfun
  derivative; `blinfun_apply_Dblinfun` proves the rep is faithful where `G` is
  differentiable (finite-dim ⇒ Fréchet derivative is bounded-linear).
- `Ck1_on_imp_has_derivative_blinfun`: `Ck_on (Suc 0) G W` ⇒
  `(G has_derivative blinfun_apply (Dblinfun G z)) (at z)` for `z∈W`  (= `derG`).
- `Ck1_on_imp_continuous_Dblinfun`: `Ck_on (Suc 0) G W` ⇒
  `continuous_on W (Dblinfun G)`  (= `contG'`). Crux: per-direction continuity of
  `frechet_derivative` (from `Ck_at 1`) ⇒ operator-norm continuity, via
  `continuous_on_blinfun_componentwise` (finite-dim) + `continuous_on_eq`.
- `Ck1_on_imp_C1_interface`: the two packaged in the engine's exact shape.

Lesson (logged): header `text` blocks **before** `theory … begin` cannot resolve
`\<^const>`/`@{thm}` antiquotations — keep the pre-`theory` header plain prose.

**Next:** instantiate `regular_value_local_chart` at `'c := real^'m`, `'b := real^2`,
feed it `Dblinfun` via `Ck1_on_imp_C1_interface` (after adding a `Ck_on 1 G (V×Ω)`
hypothesis to the keystone), and repackage into
`regular_zero_set_projection_local_chart_2d`'s `differentiable_on`/`homeomorphism`
conclusion.

### Done this session — the keystone `regular_zero_set_projection_local_chart_2d`

Discharged the keystone sorry in `Parametric_Transversality_Euclidean_Base.thy`.
Verified: `Applied_Math_Nonemptiness` `BUILD_EXIT=[0]` (14s, reusing the
Base/BlockDet heaps — Munkres/JNF/Perron untouched in the heap).

Design decision: rather than import the higher-diff theory into the (heavy,
Munkres-rooted) Nonemptiness session graph, the keystone now takes the C¹ data in
the engine's **native language** — `fixes G'` + `assumes derG` (blinfun-valued
derivative on `V×Ω`) + `contG'` (`continuous_on (V×Ω) G'`). This keeps
`Smooth_Manifolds` out of the main graph; `Ck1_C1_Bridge.Ck1_on_imp_C1_interface`
is applied later, at the *concrete* call site, to manufacture exactly `derG`+`contG'`.

Proof: `W = V×Ω` open (`open_Times`); `p∈W`, `G p = 0` from `p∈M`; `regp`
(surjectivity of `G' p`) recovered from `regular_value_on` + `derG` via
`has_derivative_unique` (on open `W`, `at p within W = at p`); then a single
`regular_value_local_chart[OF …]` and `blast` (dropping the engine's extra `Dφ`
conjuncts; `unfolding M_def` to match the level set). The lemma as *originally*
stated (only `regular_value_on`, no C¹) was **not provable** — `regular_value_on`
gives a pointwise surjective derivative but no continuity, and the IFT needs C¹;
this is the same gap that forced the C¹ hypothesis onto `charts_core_Nn` (05-27).

Threaded the same `G'`/`derG`/`contG'` through the keystone's only caller,
`countable_chart_cover_of_levelset_2d` (which has no callers of its own, so
propagation stops). Remaining sorries in the file: `charts_core_2d` (369) and
`parametric_transversality_meager_euclidean_stub` (1015).

### Finding: the moment map M_paper *will* need C¹ — but for Paper:3650, not the keystone

Checked whether `Moment_Map.thy`'s base-function derivatives need a C¹ upgrade for
the work just done. **They do not** — the keystone is generic and its concrete `G`
is the *array factor* (`(real^2)^N × real^2 → real^2`), whose C¹-ness comes from
analyticity (`C1_cplx_r2_comp`), not from the moment map.

However, `rank_lower_semicont_open_dense_propagation` (`Nonemptiness_Paper.thy:3650`,
the one open sorry there) is about the moment map `M_paper`. Its current
hypotheses (`deriv` = pointwise `has_derivative` within `V`, `one_regular`) are
**insufficient**: open-density of the surjective stratum rests on lower
semicontinuity of `rank`, which requires `DℱF` to vary *continuously* — i.e. C¹.
So that lemma must gain a continuity-of-derivative hypothesis, and instantiating
it with the concrete `M_paper` then requires `M_paper` to be C¹. Since
`Moment_Map.thy` already computes every per-term Fréchet derivative, proving
`Ck_on 1 M_paper …` there (via `Ck1_C1_Bridge`) is the right next step — necessary
for Paper:3650, and the natural concrete use of the higher-diff theory.

### Done this session — `M_paper` is C¹ (`Moment_Map.thy`, Layer 6, sorry-free)

Added a "Layer 6" to `BlockDet/Moment_Map.thy` proving continuity of the
configuration-derivative. Verified: `Applied_Math_BlockDet` + downstream
`Applied_Math_Nonemptiness` `BUILD_EXIT=[0]`.

Decision (same as the keystone): prove it in **native** `has_derivative`/
`continuous_on` language, *not* via `Ck_on`/`Ck1_C1_Bridge` — because the
derivative `DM_paper_x` is already explicit (Layer 5), so C¹ here is a pure
*continuity* obligation, not a differentiability one, and going through
`frechet_derivative`/`Ck_on` would needlessly drag `Smooth_Manifolds` into the
`Applied_Math_BlockDet` heap. (The higher-diff theory is the right tool when we
must *establish* differentiability; here we already have the derivative.)

Chain: `continuous_on_phase_x` / `continuous_on_d_phase_x` (the phase factor and
its differential are continuous in the base point — `cis ∘ (linear)`); a shared
`moment_cont_intros` intro-set discharges all six per-moment derivative
continuities (`continuous_on_d_{A,M1,M2,M11,M12,M22}_moment_x`) as finite sums of
products of `of_real`-lifted polynomials and the phase; `continuous_on_DM_paper_x_vec`
assembles the `complex^6` vector (via `continuous_on_vec_lambda` + `exhaust_6`);
`continuous_on_Blinfun_DM_paper_x` upgrades to operator-norm continuity
(`continuous_on_blinfun_componentwise`, using `bounded_linear_DM_paper_x` from
`has_derivative_M_paper_x` to make the `Blinfun` rep faithful). Final bundle
`C1_M_paper_x`: `(∀x∈V. (M_paper(·,c) has_derivative blinfun_apply(Blinfun(DM_paper_x x c))) (at x within V)) ∧ continuous_on V (λx. Blinfun (DM_paper_x x c))`
— the `derG`+`contG'` pair for the rank argument.

Needed two extra imports (`HOL-Analysis.Bounded_Linear_Function`,
`HOL-Analysis.Cartesian_Euclidean_Space`). Trap re-logged: a bare `C\<^sup>1` in
prose text (outside a `\<open>…\<close>` cartouche) is parsed as an undefined `\<^sup>`
antiquotation — keep superscripts inside cartouches.

**Next:** prove `rank_lower_semicont_open_dense_propagation` (`Nonemptiness_Paper.thy:3650`),
adding a continuity-of-derivative (C¹) hypothesis and discharging it for the
concrete moment map via `C1_M_paper_x`; that yields `DM_paper_open_dense_surjective`
→ `ZH0surj` → `prop_regnonzero`.

### Plan written down + the density-needs-analyticity finding (P1 arc)

Wrote [P1_PLAN.md](P1_PLAN.md): the moment-map branch P1.1–P1.7 with status, since
the `P1.x` labels previously lived only in commit messages (no tracked plan, no
"P1.4"). What we did this arc (keystone + `M_paper` C¹) is the natural P1.4.
Also confirmed: `bigJ_det = -(5·π⁸)/3`, `bigJ_surj` are **already proven**
(BlockDet, 0 sorry — the 05‑27 "deferred to last" item is done).

**Critical finding (ultrathink).** `rank_lower_semicont_open_dense_propagation`
(P1.6) is **not** provable from C¹: its conclusion forces the surjective stratum
to be *dense* (`V ⊆ closure U`), and the docstring's "openness + one regular point
+ connectedness ⟹ density" is **false** — counterexample: a C¹ map on connected
`ℝ` with derivative non-zero at `0` but `≡ 0` on `[1,2]` has a non-dense surjective
stratum. C¹ gives only *openness*; **density needs real-analyticity** of the
Jacobian. User chose to build the analytic density unconditionally.

**Good news:** the analytic engine is **already built and proven** for the
array-factor branch — `lines_entire_identity` / `lines_entire_slice_nowhere_dense`
(1‑D line-restriction identity theorem via `analytic_continuation`) plus the
`cline_entire`/`rline_entire` closure algebra. So P1.6 is *instantiation*, not
from-scratch building.

### Done this session — moment-map base cases for the entire-line-restriction algebra

Added to `Nonemptiness_Paper.thy` (sorry-free; `Applied_Math_Nonemptiness`
`BUILD_EXIT=[0]`): the closure base cases the moment-map minor needs but the array
factor didn't — `rline_entire_coord` (a single coordinate `(x$n)$k` is affine in
the line parameter ⟹ entire), `cline_entire_phase`, `rline_entire_cos_inner`,
`rline_entire_sin_inner` (`cos`/`sin (c · (x$n))` are `Re`/`Im` of the `cis`-phase).
With `det` = sum-of-products of entries and the existing `rline_entire_add/_mult/_sum`,
the 12×12 Jacobian minor `m*` will be `rline_entire`.

**Next (P1.5, the prerequisite):** the Jacobian identification
`DM_paper_x x0_paper c0_paper = (*v) bigJ`, giving `m*(x0_paper) = det bigJ ≠ 0`
(nontriviality) and `surj` at the base point. Then P1.6 instantiation (steps 1–7
in `P1_PLAN.md`), then P1.7 assembly.

### Done this session — P1.5 arithmetic foundation (base-point phase values)

Began P1.5 (the Jacobian identification `D_x M_paper(x0_paper, c0_paper) = (*v) bigJ`,
`Nonemptiness_Paper.thy`). Established the arithmetic substrate, sorry-free,
`Applied_Math_Nonemptiness` `BUILD_EXIT=[0]`.

Precise statement of the reduction (for the paper): the canonical base
configuration `x0_paper` has six points whose first ("`u`") coordinates are the
equally-spaced angles `u_n ∈ {0, π/3, 2π/3, π, 4π/3, 5π/3}`, and the steering
vector is `c0_paper = (1,0)`. Hence the steering form at point `n` is
`c0_paper · (x0_paper$n) = u_n`, and the phase factor is
`phase c0_paper x0_paper n = cis(-u_n) = cos u_n − 𝚤·sin u_n`. Every entry of the
12×12 Jacobian `D_x M_paper(x0_paper, c0_paper)` is therefore a polynomial in the
base coordinates and in `cos u_n`, `sin u_n` — i.e. expressible through `cos`/`sin`
at these six angles, which are the sixth roots of unity.

Lemmas added (`Nonemptiness_Paper.thy`, after the `x0_paper`/`c0_paper` block):
- `sqrt3_sq`: `sqrt 3 * sqrt 3 = 3` (via `real_sqrt_pow2`).
- `base_trig_values`: the twelve closed forms
  `cos/sin` of `0, π/3, 2π/3, π, 4π/3, 5π/3`
  (`= 1,0; 1/2,√3/2; −1/2,√3/2; −1,0; −1/2,−√3/2; 1/2,−√3/2`). Proved by explicit
  calculational Isar from `cos_add`/`sin_add` and the `π/3` values (`cos_60`,
  `sin_60`), isolating the single `sqrt3_sq` step where `cos(2π/3)` needs
  `(√3/2)² = 3/4`; `5π/3` reuses the `2π/3` values. (Replaced the initial
  one-line `simp` attempts, which were fragile around `√3·√3`.)

### Performance pathology + fix: nested vec-projection under `HMA_Connect`/`Conformal_Mappings`

Building the real-linear transports between `(real^2)^6`/`complex^6` and the
`real^12` of `bigJ` exposed a sharp performance trap, worth recording for the
paper's formalization notes.

- The transports: `transC : complex^6 → real^12`, `transD : real^12 → (real^2)^6`,
  and their inverses, defined by explicit `vector [...]`. `transD_inv` is the only
  one with a **nested** projection `(c$i)$j` (flattening `(real^2)^6` into 12 reals).
- **Symptom:** in `Nonemptiness_Paper` (which imports `Perron_Frobenius.HMA_Connect`
  and `HOL-Complex_Analysis.Conformal_Mappings`) the *definition* of `transD_inv`
  never finishes elaborating — in batch it ran 24 min then died "Run out of store";
  in jEdit it sits purple forever. The single-projection transports are fine.
- **Isolated reproduction:** the identical definitions build in **4 s** when the
  theory imports only `Block_Determinants`; adding `HMA_Connect` +
  `Conformal_Mappings` makes the same `transD_inv` time out. So the cost is the
  *import context* interacting with nested vec-projection elaboration (pinning the
  index types `(c$(i::6))$(j::2)` did **not** help — it is not numeral inference).
- **Fix (architectural):** define the transports (and, next, the Jacobian
  identification) in `BlockDet/Moment_Jacobian.thy`, which imports only the
  `HMA_Connect`/`Conformal_Mappings`-free moment-map theories (`Moment_Map`,
  `Block_Determinants_BigJ`). There the nested projection elaborates in
  milliseconds; the definitions are baked into the `Applied_Math_BlockDet` heap,
  and `Nonemptiness_Paper` merely *uses* the constants (using a constant never
  re-runs its definition's elaboration). Verified: `Applied_Math_BlockDet` +
  `Applied_Math_Nonemptiness` `BUILD_EXIT=[0]`.
- **Proof engineering (separate point):** the transport lemmas reduce each vec
  equality to per-component facts via a *bounded* `exhaust_N` case split
  (`exhaust_12[of i]` + `elim disjE; simp`); a blanket `forall_12`/`vec_eq_iff`
  simp over the nested `vector[...]` also exhausts memory and must be avoided.

`Moment_Jacobian.thy` now contains `transC`/`transC_inv`/`transD`/`transD_inv`
with `linear_*`, `*_inv_left/right`, and `bij_transC`/`bij_transD` (all sorry-free).

### Session architecture: the edited theory must not be in its own logic heap

`Moment_Jacobian` is where the Jacobian identification (`D_x M_paper(x0,c0) = (*v) bigJ`)
is being actively developed, so it cannot sit in the heap we load to edit it. Moved
it to its **own directory + session** `Applied_Math_MomentJac in "MomentJac"`,
parented on `Applied_Math_BlockDet`. Also moved the base configuration
(`x0_paper`, `c0_paper`, their `*_entries`/`*_values` lemmas, `sqrt3_sq`,
`base_trig_values`) out of `Nonemptiness_Paper` into `Moment_Jacobian`, since the
identification needs them in this clean (HMA-free) context and `Moment_Jacobian`
cannot import `Nonemptiness_Paper`. `Nonemptiness_Paper` no longer imports
`Moment_Jacobian` during development (it used none of those names yet); it will be
rewired once the identification is proved.

- **Edit** `MomentJac/Moment_Jacobian.thy` with `-l Applied_Math_BlockDet`
  (deps from the heap, the theory itself live — fast, no staleness).
- **Batch-verify** with `isabelle build … Applied_Math_MomentJac` (~3 s on the
  prebuilt BlockDet heap).

Verified: `Applied_Math_BlockDet` (clean, no `Moment_Jacobian`) +
`Applied_Math_Nonemptiness` (decoupled) + `Applied_Math_MomentJac` all
`BUILD_EXIT=[0]`. (ROOT-comment trap re-logged: `(*v)` inside an Isabelle `(* … *)`
comment opens a nested comment and breaks parsing — write it without the `(*`.)

**Next within P1.5:** compute `D_x M_paper(x0_paper, c0_paper)` column by column
— for each base point `n` and coordinate `k`, the directional derivative
collapses the moment sums to the single `n`-th term, giving an explicit
`complex^6` vector whose `Re`/`Im` parts (via `base_trig_values`) must match the
corresponding column of `bigJ` — then assemble the 12×12 identification and read
off `surj (DM_paper_x x0_paper c0_paper)` (from `bigJ_surj`) and
`det = det bigJ ≠ 0`.

### Next target (where this resumes)

Discharge `regular_zero_set_projection_local_chart_2d` from
`regular_value_local_chart` by instantiating `'c := real^'m`, `'b := real^2`, and
supplying the missing **C¹** hypothesis via `Ck_on 1 G (V×Ω)`. Concretely:
1. register `Regular_Value_Theorem` (and then `Parametric_Transversality_*`) in a
   session whose base sees both HOL-Analysis and `Applied_Math_HigherDiff`;
2. add a `Ck_on 1 G (V×Ω)` hypothesis to the keystone (mirroring how the C¹
   hypothesis was threaded through `charts_core_Nn` on 05-27);
3. extract `G'` + `continuous_on (V×Ω) G'` + the point-`p` surjectivity from
   `regular_value_on` + C¹, then apply the engine and repackage its conclusion
   into the keystone's `differentiable_on`/`homeomorphism` shape.

## 2026-05-27 — The regular-value branch: `charts_core_Nn` from sorry to QED

### Where this fits

The nonemptiness theorem reduces (via Baire category) to showing four "bad" sets
are meager in a nonempty open working set `V`. Two of the four branches are
*regular-value* branches: the bad set is contained in a countable union of
lower-dimensional smooth images, hence Lebesgue-negligible, hence (being closed)
nowhere dense, hence meager. The combinatorial heart of that argument is a single
lemma, `charts_core_Nn`: at a regular value `0` of the parameter map `G`, the set
of base points `x` over which the ω-fibre derivative degenerates is covered by
countably many *closed* chart images on which a projection has everywhere-singular
derivative. Feeding this to a Sard-type negligibility lemma closes the branch.

At the start of the day `charts_core_Nn` was a single `sorry`. By the end it was
proved with no `sorry`, on the back of seven supporting lemmas built and verified
in sequence. This is the spine of the regular-value branches and the most
differential-topology-heavy part of the development.

### What was built, in order

- **`d880ba3` — chart derivative exposed.** The self-contained regular-value
  theorem (`Regular_Value_Theorem.thy`, IFT-based, AFP-targetable) produced a
  chart `φ` of the zero set but did not expose its derivative. We strengthened
  `regular_value_local_chart` to also return `Dφ` as a bounded linear map
  (`blinfun`), together with the key identity `range(Dφ u) = ker(DG_{φ u})`. The
  chart derivative is `h ↦ inv(DF)(h,0)` for the augmented square map `F`; its
  range is exactly the tangent space of the zero set.

- **`cf82b5d`, `5520534` — the C¹ hypothesis.** A subtle but real gap: the chart
  comes from the inverse function theorem, which needs `G` to be **C¹** (a
  *continuous* blinfun-valued derivative), not merely to have a surjective
  derivative at the zeros (which is all `regular_value_on` provides). We added an
  explicit C¹ hypothesis to `charts_core_Nn` and threaded it through the two
  `parametric_transversality_*_complex` lemmas and `prop_regzero`, discharging it
  at the top from the analyticity of the array factor via the reusable
  `C1_cplx_r2_comp` (composition with the bounded-linear `cplx_r2`). The
  redundant differentiability hypothesis `A_smooth` was removed — C¹ subsumes it.
  *Getting the hypotheses exactly right, and no stronger, was a deliberate design
  choice.*

- **`81c359b` — `chart_proj_surj_iff`.** Pure linear algebra: if `range(Dφ) =
  ker(L)` for a surjective `L = DG`, then the `x`-factor projection `fst∘Dφ` is
  surjective **iff** the ω-partial `b ↦ L(0,b)` is. This is the bridge from
  "chart point is regular for the projection" to "ω-derivative is non-degenerate."

- **`21762a0` — `partial_omega_deriv`, `exists_surj_deriv_iff_partial`.** Identify
  the ω-slice derivative of `G` as `h ↦ DG(0,h)` (chain rule on the affine slice
  `u ↦ (x,u)`), and show on an open `Ω` that the abstract "no surjective slice
  derivative exists" condition is equivalent to concrete non-surjectivity of that
  unique partial. This lets the bad set be written cleanly as `fst ` BadZeros`.

- **`a9be237` — `bad_zero_chart`.** Package, per bad zero `q`, the chart together
  with a closed ball `cball u0 r ⊆ U`: on it `φ` is continuous, lands in the zero
  set, carries `Dφ` with `range = ker(DG)`, and `φ`(ball)` is an openin-`M`
  neighbourhood of `q` (the input to Lindelöf).

- **`c1bd9f4` — `crit_piece_compact`.** Each critical piece is compact: on the
  closed ball, the set where the ω-partial (a self-map of `ℝ²`) is non-surjective
  is the zero set of `x ↦ det` of a continuous `2×2` matrix field, hence
  closed-in-the-compact-ball, hence compact. This is what makes the chart images
  *closed* (continuous image of a compact set), which the meager conclusion needs.

- **`581f6b2` — `charts_core_Nn`.** The assembly. Recover the continuous `G'`;
  show the bad set equals `fst ` BadZeros`; obtain a chart bundle at every bad
  zero; skolemise the four chart-data functions through a single tuple-valued
  choice; take a countable subcover of the openin-`M` chart neighbourhoods with
  `Lindelof_openin`; reindex by `from_nat_into`; and discharge the four conjuncts
  — cover, projected-chart derivative as a blinfun, everywhere-singular derivative
  on the critical set, and closedness.

### Two lessons worth recording (and arguably worth a footnote in the paper)

1. **Type-annotate existential and `obtain` binders, always.** An existential
   `∃u0 r φ Dφ. … φ u0 = q … φ u ∈ W …` looks fully determined, but nothing in the
   body forces `type(u0)` to be the chart-domain type `'c`: `φ`'s *domain* is
   unconstrained, because the predicate only ever applies `φ`. Isabelle therefore
   generalizes `u0` to a fresh rigid type variable, and then **no** tactic —
   `blast`, explicit `exI`-witnesses, structured `intro` — can unify a genuine
   `'c`-typed witness against a foreign type variable. The fix is one line:
   `∃(u0::'c) (r::real) (φ::'c⇒'c×'b) (Dφ::…). …`. This cost the better part of an
   afternoon across `bad_zero_chart` and the `exch` step of `charts_core_Nn`. Rule
   of thumb: *if a binder's type is pinned only through a function applied to it,
   annotate it explicitly — function domains do not propagate the constraint.*

2. **Multi-function choice needs an explicit `SOME`, not automation.** Going from
   `∀q∈BZ. ∃u0 r φ Dφ. P q u0 r φ Dφ` to four skolem functions
   `u0f, rf, φf, Dφf` is the axiom of choice with a four-fold codomain. `blast`
   and `metis` cannot perform this higher-order, multi-function skolemization. The
   clean route is a single tuple-valued choice function
   `sk q = (SOME t. P q (fst t) (fst(snd t)) (fst(snd(snd t))) (snd(snd(snd t))))`,
   justified by `someI_ex`, with the four projections defined off it. (As a bonus
   trap: when annotating the tuple's type, `(real^2)^'n × real × …` parses as
   `(real^2) ^ ('n × real × …)` — the vec exponent greedily grabs the whole tuple
   — so the first factor needs its own parentheses, `((real^2)^'n) × real × …`.)

### Status at end of day

`charts_core_Nn` is `sorry`-free, so the regular-value branch
(`parametric_transversality_negligible_complex`,
`parametric_transversality_meager_complex`, `prop_regzero`) is proved modulo
nothing in the chart cover. Three `sorry`s remain in `Nonemptiness_Paper.thy`:

- `chart_zero_projection_meager_stub` — the fold-zero branch (1-D transversality →
  meager), still open;
- `bigJ_det` — the explicit `12×12` Jacobian determinant `det bigJ = -(5·π⁸)/3`,
  deliberately deferred to last;
- `Dx_moment_map_surjective` — surjectivity wrapper that consumes `bigJ_det`.

The fold-*nonzero* branch's analytic input (`dU_cart` nowhere-density via the
entire-line-restriction identity theorem and `lem_Efinite`) was completed in
earlier sessions; what remains there is the non-analytic nontriviality input.
