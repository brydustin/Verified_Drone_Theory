# Formalization Diary — Antenna Feasibility Nonemptiness

A running, dated log of the Isabelle/HOL formalization of the antenna-feasibility
*nonemptiness* theorem. Kept partly as a development record and partly as raw
material for the paper's "formalization notes." Entries are newest-first within a
day; commit hashes refer to the working repo (`antenna-nonemptiness`), mirrored

## 2026-05-27 — The regular-value branch: `charts_core_Nn` from sorry to QED

### Where this fits

The nonemptiness theorem reduces (via Baire category) to showing four "bad" sets
are meager in a nonempty open working set `V`. Two of the four branches are
*regular-value* branches: the bad set is contained in a countable union of
lower-dimensional smooth images, hence Lebesgue-negligible, hence (being closed)
nowhere dense, hence meager. The combinatorial heart of that argument is a single
lemma, `charts_core_Nn`: at a regular value `0` of the parameter map `G`, the set
of base points `x` over which the ω-fibre derivative degenerates is covered by
countably many *closed* chart images on which a projection has everywhere-singular
derivative. Feeding this to a Sard-type negligibility lemma closes the branch.

At the start of the day `charts_core_Nn` was a single `sorry`. By the end it was
proved with no `sorry`, on the back of seven supporting lemmas built and verified
in sequence. This is the spine of the regular-value branches and the most
differential-topology-heavy part of the development.

### What was built, in order

- **`d880ba3` — chart derivative exposed.** The self-contained regular-value
  theorem (`Regular_Value_Theorem.thy`, IFT-based, AFP-targetable) produced a
  chart `φ` of the zero set but did not expose its derivative. We strengthened
  `regular_value_local_chart` to also return `Dφ` as a bounded linear map
  (`blinfun`), together with the key identity `range(Dφ u) = ker(DG_{φ u})`. The
  chart derivative is `h ↦ inv(DF)(h,0)` for the augmented square map `F`; its
  range is exactly the tangent space of the zero set.

- **`cf82b5d`, `5520534` — the C¹ hypothesis.** A subtle but real gap: the chart
  comes from the inverse function theorem, which needs `G` to be **C¹** (a
  *continuous* blinfun-valued derivative), not merely to have a surjective
  derivative at the zeros (which is all `regular_value_on` provides). We added an
  explicit C¹ hypothesis to `charts_core_Nn` and threaded it through the two
  `parametric_transversality_*_complex` lemmas and `prop_regzero`, discharging it
  at the top from the analyticity of the array factor via the reusable
  `C1_cplx_r2_comp` (composition with the bounded-linear `cplx_r2`). The
  redundant differentiability hypothesis `A_smooth` was removed — C¹ subsumes it.
  *Getting the hypotheses exactly right, and no stronger, was a deliberate design
  choice.*

- **`81c359b` — `chart_proj_surj_iff`.** Pure linear algebra: if `range(Dφ) =
  ker(L)` for a surjective `L = DG`, then the `x`-factor projection `fst∘Dφ` is
  surjective **iff** the ω-partial `b ↦ L(0,b)` is. This is the bridge from
  "chart point is regular for the projection" to "ω-derivative is non-degenerate."

- **`21762a0` — `partial_omega_deriv`, `exists_surj_deriv_iff_partial`.** Identify
  the ω-slice derivative of `G` as `h ↦ DG(0,h)` (chain rule on the affine slice
  `u ↦ (x,u)`), and show on an open `Ω` that the abstract "no surjective slice
  derivative exists" condition is equivalent to concrete non-surjectivity of that
  unique partial. This lets the bad set be written cleanly as `fst ` BadZeros`.

- **`a9be237` — `bad_zero_chart`.** Package, per bad zero `q`, the chart together
  with a closed ball `cball u0 r ⊆ U`: on it `φ` is continuous, lands in the zero
  set, carries `Dφ` with `range = ker(DG)`, and `φ`(ball)` is an openin-`M`
  neighbourhood of `q` (the input to Lindelöf).

- **`c1bd9f4` — `crit_piece_compact`.** Each critical piece is compact: on the
  closed ball, the set where the ω-partial (a self-map of `ℝ²`) is non-surjective
  is the zero set of `x ↦ det` of a continuous `2×2` matrix field, hence
  closed-in-the-compact-ball, hence compact. This is what makes the chart images
  *closed* (continuous image of a compact set), which the meager conclusion needs.

- **`581f6b2` — `charts_core_Nn`.** The assembly. Recover the continuous `G'`;
  show the bad set equals `fst ` BadZeros`; obtain a chart bundle at every bad
  zero; skolemise the four chart-data functions through a single tuple-valued
  choice; take a countable subcover of the openin-`M` chart neighbourhoods with
  `Lindelof_openin`; reindex by `from_nat_into`; and discharge the four conjuncts
  — cover, projected-chart derivative as a blinfun, everywhere-singular derivative
  on the critical set, and closedness.

### Two lessons worth recording (and arguably worth a footnote in the paper)

1. **Type-annotate existential and `obtain` binders, always.** An existential
   `∃u0 r φ Dφ. … φ u0 = q … φ u ∈ W …` looks fully determined, but nothing in the
   body forces `type(u0)` to be the chart-domain type `'c`: `φ`'s *domain* is
   unconstrained, because the predicate only ever applies `φ`. Isabelle therefore
   generalizes `u0` to a fresh rigid type variable, and then **no** tactic —
   `blast`, explicit `exI`-witnesses, structured `intro` — can unify a genuine
   `'c`-typed witness against a foreign type variable. The fix is one line:
   `∃(u0::'c) (r::real) (φ::'c⇒'c×'b) (Dφ::…). …`. This cost the better part of an
   afternoon across `bad_zero_chart` and the `exch` step of `charts_core_Nn`. Rule
   of thumb: *if a binder's type is pinned only through a function applied to it,
   annotate it explicitly — function domains do not propagate the constraint.*

2. **Multi-function choice needs an explicit `SOME`, not automation.** Going from
   `∀q∈BZ. ∃u0 r φ Dφ. P q u0 r φ Dφ` to four skolem functions
   `u0f, rf, φf, Dφf` is the axiom of choice with a four-fold codomain. `blast`
   and `metis` cannot perform this higher-order, multi-function skolemization. The
   clean route is a single tuple-valued choice function
   `sk q = (SOME t. P q (fst t) (fst(snd t)) (fst(snd(snd t))) (snd(snd(snd t))))`,
   justified by `someI_ex`, with the four projections defined off it. (As a bonus
   trap: when annotating the tuple's type, `(real^2)^'n × real × …` parses as
   `(real^2) ^ ('n × real × …)` — the vec exponent greedily grabs the whole tuple
   — so the first factor needs its own parentheses, `((real^2)^'n) × real × …`.)

### Status at end of day

`charts_core_Nn` is `sorry`-free, so the regular-value branch
(`parametric_transversality_negligible_complex`,
`parametric_transversality_meager_complex`, `prop_regzero`) is proved modulo
nothing in the chart cover. Three `sorry`s remain in `Nonemptiness_Paper.thy`:

- `chart_zero_projection_meager_stub` — the fold-zero branch (1-D transversality →
  meager), still open;
- `bigJ_det` — the explicit `12×12` Jacobian determinant `det bigJ = -(5·π⁸)/3`,
  deliberately deferred to last;
- `Dx_moment_map_surjective` — surjectivity wrapper that consumes `bigJ_det`.

The fold-*nonzero* branch's analytic input (`dU_cart` nowhere-density via the
entire-line-restriction identity theorem and `lem_Efinite`) was completed in
earlier sessions; what remains there is the non-analytic nontriviality input.
